Market Strategy
===============

* `Indirect Competition`_, `Opinion Leaders`_
* customers only care about what the product will do for them
* a product or service need to solves a real problem in more effective way, but not necessarily
higher-tech, than available alternatives
* talk with potential customers in the early step, and find out how the market works and what
the real problems are
* know who the competitors are, what they do, how they make money, how good their products are
and why people buy them

Indirect Competition
--------------------
    * customer solving the problem with in-house solution
    * customer adopting a different working practice that makes the problem irrelevant
    * customer tolerate the problem as their money is limited and invest money on other things
    that they think will get a better return on investment
* identify where in the market to offer a product different from the competition and a customer
a compelling reason to buy
* customer purchase decision-making will pay significant attention to the potential downside
and the risk

Opinion Leaders
---------------
    *  have influence on the customers in technology markets
    * identify, engage and get them on the same side
    * it is worth to investigate whether it is possible to define market segments in terms of
    them
    * engaging them can sometimes lead to automatic, free-of-charge business advantage
* learn how the market works, decide which market segments to go for, and use the networks in
the segments to increase selling effort
* product-based company should have the potential to be large and global, and the market
should be at an early stage of exploitation
* service-based company should allow the customer to get end result more efficiently
* entering a mature market without distinct offering could lead to failure
* it is important to be first to market as it will allow to shape customer expectations, charge
a premium and obtain first-mover publicity

Value Creation
==============

* `Lifestyle Business`_, `Rapid Growth`_, `Business Goals`_, `Business Models`_, `Business Plan`_
* `Novelty`_
* value creation options will depend the personal choice and availability of finance

Lifestyle Business
------------------
    * in control of operations, few employees, and flexible with own time and resources
    * primary value will be created through cash flow
    * choose to invest that cash in other ventures, reinvest in own business, or create other
    forms of savings
    * will be dependent on the cash and growth in the business

Rapid Growth
------------
    * might have to give up some of shares and control
    * manage more complex work situations, and deal with investors
    * plenty of scope for travel overseas, and spend long hours on the road

Business Goals
--------------
    * **New Entrepreneurs**
        - build credibility and experience, and get an understanding of how the market works
        - can start with some form of consulting business
        - lower risks, but selling consulting services to raise money for product development
        can delay that development
    * **Higher Risk**
        - need financial resources, strong team and global market with significant potential
        demand
        - can make an objective to raise sums of money from venture capital and other sources
        - expecting the business to grow with speed to enable investors to realise value
        through some form of exit, e.g. sale of shares to other business or via flotation on
        the stock market

Business Models
---------------
    * choice of models will have an impact on the final value
    * be very clear about the business model
    * start-up companies will find it difficult to mix business models
    * do not develop products and deliver consulting expertise
    * **Licensing Idea**
        - it may require to make further investment to prove that the technology works and
        that there is a market for it
        - but can expect to receive a part of the value when the idea is brought to the market
        by those who have licensed it
        - need to find the right licensees, good legal advice on contracts and the protection
        of intellectual property
        - e.g. biotechnology companies develop potential new medicines and license them to
        pharmaceutical companies
    * **Full Ownership**
        - own various forms of diluted ownership with co-investment by other firms and people
        - going it alone has the highest risks
        - must be fully committed, but can expect the greatest rewards if it all works out
        - fit teams who are experienced in business and have a desire to grow a large business
        for a large return
    * **Joint Ventures**
        - reduces the risks, but can be complicated to set up
        - need to find a company that is willing to co-develop the technology or the market
        - fit teams who are experienced in business and have a desire to grow a large business
        for a large return
        - e.g. shared flights in the airline industry
    * **Product Development & Sale**
        - growing a products business requires more capital than growing a services company
        - more risky as the company is unlikely to get a second chance if the first fails
        - but rewards can be great if the product is successful
    * **Services Delivery**
        - less risky to grow the company, but growth will be slower
        - staff numbers will need to double in order to double company revenue
    * **IP licensing**
        - very competitive and often does not appear to have more than one large player in
        each market sector
        - important to ensure to follow through with succeeding generations of IP

Business Plan
-------------
    * necessary document that will help or hinder attempts to raise outside finance
    * can be extremely time consuming, seek external advice
    * **Internal Plan**
        - personal objectives, product or service to sell
        - itinerary to develop the technology, market research, recruit,and acquire other
        resources
        - should be reviewed continuously, and make simple budgets and cash flow forecasts
        - style and content reflect only the internal needs of the business
        - becomes more formal as the business develops, and a specific plan, based on the
        internal plan, may be necessary
    * important to understand that the needs of equity investors and bankers are different
    * **Plan Emphasis**
        - depends on the stage of the business
        - start-up: its people, product and the quality of market research
        - developed business: emphasise its track record
    * **External Plan**
        - company and management background, staff structure, market, production, product and
        details of IP
        - financial forecasts, competition, risk and reward for potential financiers
        - how the product will be sold, time scale and benchmarks, mainly for overcoming
        barriers to market entry
        - if the plan is to raise equity, must include business's unique selling point
        - must be reviewed before going public
    * **Executive Summary**
        - written after the plan is finished, must introduced the plan with it
        - has to attract attention and should be short, two or three pages
        - but must be sharp, bringing out the key selling points
        - write in a way that an investor with no special knowledge can quickly understand the
        business and what is in it for him
    * once potential investors form a negative perception of the business, it is often
    impossible to change it

Novelty
-------
    * the new offering must be sufficiently different to be attractive to clients
    * investors like companies whose offerings have a significant degree of novelty
    * product must be sufficiently novel
    * intellectual property, patents, in the product must be defensible, i.e. a competitor
    should not be able to steal it
    * the product should not be launched before the market has developed
    * new markets are generally slower to take off than expected
* most successful technology companies raise three or four rounds of finance prior to flotation
or the sale of the company
* it is necessary to convince the first-round financiers that the team is credible, product is
novel, there is a large global market and proposition is sustainable
* execute flawlessly and maintain focus, do not think too long, and go into market and do it

Team Building
=============

* `Team Roles`_, `Recruitment`_
* find partners that can be trusted and get along with, two or three people make a sufficient

first-stage funding is secured
* fill the remaining key management gaps within a reasonable period
* communicate, share business vision, build trust, clarify and formalise roles through the
business plan

Company Structure
=================

* `Directors`_, `Shareholders`_
* a company offers limited liability, risks are taken by the company rather than as an
individual, so that personal assets can be safe if the business goes wrong
* every company must have public documents such as Memorandum, objectives and share capital,
Articles of Association, how the company should be run
* do not allow investors to mess with the Memorandum and Articles of the company
* register certain documents with the Registrar of Companies, and appoint auditors and submit
audited accounts annually to Companies House
* can purchase companies read-formed from company formation agents, or ask a firm of lawyers to
set up with tailored Memorandum and Articles
* address legal and taxation issues at an early stage
* e.g. share option agreement isn't needed when only the founders are working for the company,
and directors liability insurance is only needed when a certain type of company is actively
trading
* as an individual, consider shareholding from family's point of view, and find the best way to
obtain income from the company in the future

Directors
---------
    * must be legally in the best interests of the company
    * cannot make decisions for personal benefits
    * have to declare conflicting interest, that will be decided by the board, to other directors
    * a director must not discuss or vote on any issue where there is a conflict of interest
    * may need to risk personal liability in some cases, e.g. signing an agreement without
    unanimous shareholder approval

Shareholders
------------
    * key people for any new company, appoint and remove directors to run the company
    * make decisions by way of a General Meeting, where certain major decisions can only be
    made
    * but once the company framework is established, the power to run the company from day to
    day is vested in the board of directors
    * **Shareholders' Agreement**
        - who is on the board, what decisions require unanimity
        - what are the voting rights, what are the exit routes
        - what happens to shares of a deceased shareholder
        - in some where matters have reached a point that cannot move forward together, one
        shareholder can require the others to buy him out or be bought out themselves
        - most articles restrict the freedom to transfer shares
        - e.g. the share seller must offer to the fellow shareholders at the same price
        offered by an external purchaser, giving the opportunity to stop a third-party
        shareholder being imposed on them
