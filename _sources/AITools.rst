Automation
==========

* `Make`_

Make
----
    * can be found at "www.make.com"
    * no-code platform to connect applications and automate workflows
    * **Scenario**
        - a collection of modules
        - build a scenario, test, and schedule to run
        - can also add tools, flow control and text parser
        - unless named specifically, a scenario will be auto named based on app
        - best to organise scenarios in a folder
        - can run scenarios at intervals, immediately or on demand
        - can have a scenario chain, one triggering others, but must be within the same team
        - Sub-scenarios: parent scenario -> bridge scenarios -> child scenario
        - a scenario can define its input so that others can send data when triggering it
        - scenario inputs can be mapped in modules
    * **Module**
        - any element added within a scenario
        - App: a group of modules
        - Bundle: data collected from Make, can download JSON input/output bundles
        - has action, search, trigger, iterator, and aggregator modules
        - search modules cannot modify data
        - for Google apps connection, free and regular Gmail account will need to be
          reauthorised every 7 days
        - modules should be connected to pass information, and can be cloned with existing
          config
        - ACID modules support rollback features
        - JSON is used to pass information between modules
    * **Aggregators**
        - combine multiple bundles into single one
        - aggregators map, select items, and reduce, combine the selected ones
        - Tools Aggregator: table, text and numeric aggregators
        - Array Aggregator: take fields from multiple bundles, and aggregate into single array
        - output can be grouped to produce different bundles
        - data-driven aggregations can help understand business and make decisions
    * **Iterators**
        - can only extract an array and split into separate bundles
        - cannot be used as a trigger
        - without iterator, Make only processes the first item in an array
        - always check for empty array
    * **Triggers**
        - first action that launches the scenario
        - each scenario can only have one trigger
        - Polling Trigger: execute scenario at intervals, has a clock icon
        - Instant Trigger: execute scenario as soon as data arrives, has a lightning icon, can
          also be configured like a polling trigger
        - if not explicitly indicated, a trigger will always be considered polling
        - Basic Trigger: to create custom trigger, and define output bundle structure
    * **Router**
        - branch workflows onto separate paths
        - useful to process data towards separate outputs
        - will not consume any operations
        - can set the order of routes
    * **Filter**
        - allow or restrict specific data
        - has basic, text, numeric and datetime operators
        - allow AND and OR rules
    * **Scheduling**
        - define time and frequency to run the scenarios
        - always run manually and test before setting to schedule
    * **Operations**
        - Make is priced on operations usage
        - an operation is used every time a module performs an action, even if it does not
          produce a bundle, i.e. 3 operations for 3 actions
        - error handler modules, rollback, break, resume, commit, ignore, filters and routers
          do not use operations
        - save operations by running a single module only to check output bundle
        - disable routes to isolate and for less operations when testing, data cannot pass but
          the connection between modules remain
        - in a sense, an operation is used for each API call
        - if a scenario executes, it will always consume at least one operation
    * **Check Run**
        - shown when a scheduled scenario was executed, but only the trigger module was
          activated and it does not find any new data
        - can be viewed in a scenario's history
        - provide insight of operations count to manage scheduling
        - active by default on each scenario
    * **Organisations**
        - contain scenarios, teams, users and data
        - a user can belong to multiple organisations, and own as many organisations, but only
          have one free organisation
        - each organisation can have a different subscription plan
        - location cannot be changed after the organisation is created
    * **Blueprint**
        - automation template with configurations and functions
        - allow to share scenarios with others outside of the organisation
        - composed in JSON format
    * **Data Types**
        - text, number, date, boolean
        - Collection: a group of different data types as single unit, also called object
        - Array: same data type, 1-based indexing, can sort, extract a range, search, iterate,
          aggregate, and other advanced data extractions
        - entering different data type as specified will get an error, but will attempt to
          convert type if compatible
        - format of date depends on profile settings
    * **Mapping**
        - mapping data from one module into another
        - a single operation will generate at least one bundle
        - when mapping an array item, first item will be chosen if no index is given
        - need to create custom data structure when connecting to external services not
          provided by Make
    * **Functions**
        - make data transformations on fields easier
        - has general, math, text, binary, date and time, and array functions
        - scenario and functions use date/time from Organisation
        - ``get()``: extract a value from an object with dot notation on the raw name
        - ``map()``: extract values from an array, and transform them to create a new array,
          always return an array
        - use ``get(map())`` to use the data from ``map()`` in the next module
        - using ``get()`` and ``map()`` can save more operations than using aggregators and
          iterators, as functions can be mapped directly in the module
    * **Variables**
        - allow organisations to store data and reuse
        - System and Custom variables
    * **Webhooks**
        - to receive notifications as soon as an event occurs from another application
        - allow to send data to Make over HTTP, usually an instant trigger
        - can be used to connect different apps, even external, to Make
        - has a unique URL to receive a request
        - modules tagged with "Instant" have webhooks implemented
        - requests are stored in a webhook queue if the scenario is inactive, sequential
          processing is enabled, or the scenario failed
        - cannot use one webhook in multiple scenarios
        - query string, header and body are used to share information
        - can automatically determines data structure from request
    * **Errors**
        - organisations usage limit errors
        - handling and validation errors with data passed between the modules
        - API related errors
        - module timeout error (usually 40 seconds)
        - inconsistency error when multiple scenarios modify the same database
        - data is saved in the logs when an error occurs
        - a scenario can be deactivated when too many errors occur
        - Incomplete Executions: if enabled, data and blueprint from a failed scenario run
          will be saved, and continue to run, e.g. bundle 3 will be processed even if bundle 2
          causes error
        - can retry incomplete executions automatically, manually or in bulk
        - Make will not save data for incomplete executions if data is set to confidential
    * **Error Handlers**
        - connected to specific modules, and will only run when the module has an error
        - error handling route (empty dots) can have an error handler, one or more modules, or
          a combination of both
        - error handlers give more control over the scenario behaviour, and do not consume any
          operations
        - must be placed at the end of the error handling route
        - Break: only stop for the error bundle, and save an incomplete execution, can
          configure more on the retry
        - Ignore: ignore the error bundle and continue running for next bundles
        - Resume: can set a substitute value for a module output
        - Commit: only for ACID, stop the scenario and confirm changes to the module, further
          bundles will not be processed
        - Rollback: only for ACID, stop the run and revert all changes to the module, further
          bundles will not be processed
        - rollback is the default behaviour when there are no error handlers or incomplete
          executions are enabled
