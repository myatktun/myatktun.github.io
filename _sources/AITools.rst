Automation
==========

* `Make`_

Make
----
    * can be found at "www.make.com"
    * no-code platform to connect applications and automate workflows
    * **Scenario**
        - a collection of modules
        - build a scenario, test, and schedule to run at intervals
        - can also add tools, flow control and text parser
        - unless named specifically, a scenario will be auto named based on app
        - best to organise scenarios in a folder
    * **Module**
        - any element added within a scenario
        - App: a group of modules
        - Bundle: data collected from Make
        - has action, search, trigger, iterator, and aggregator modules
        - Poll Trigger: watch a service, and give updates each time a scenario is activated
        - Instant Trigger: watch an account, and return new information immediately
        - Iterator: extract an array and split into separate bundles
        - Aggregator: combine multiple bundles into single one
        - search modules cannot modify data
        - for Google apps connection, free and regular Gmail account will need to be
          reauthorised every 7 days
        - modules should be connected to pass information, and can be cloned with existing
          config
    * **Mapping**
        - mapping data from one module into another
        - a single operation will generate at least one bundle
    * **Router**
        - branch workflows onto separate paths
        - useful to process data towards separate outputs
        - will not consume any operations
        - can set the order of routes
    * **Filter**
        - allow or restrict specific data
        - has basic, text, numeric and datetime operators
        - allow AND and OR rules
    * **Scheduling**
        - define time and frequency to run the scenarios
        - always run manually and test before setting to schedule
    * **Operations**
        - Make is priced on operations usage
        - an operation is used every time a module performs an action, even if it does not
          produce a bundle, i.e. 3 operations for 3 actions
        - error handler modules, rollback, break, resume, commit, ignore, filters and routers
          do not use operations
        - save operations by running a single module only to check output bundle
        - disable routes to isolate and for less operations when testing, data cannot pass but
          the connection between modules remain
        - in a sense, an operation is used for each API call
        - if a scenario executes, it will always consume at least one operation
    * **Check Run**
        - shown when a scheduled scenario was executed, but only the trigger module was
          activated and it does not find any new data
        - can be viewed in a scenario's history
        - provide insight of operations count to manage scheduling
        - active by default on each scenario
    * **Organisations**
        - contain scenarios, teams, users and data
        - a user can belong to multiple organisations, and own as many organisations, but only
          have one free organisation
        - each organisation can have a different subscription plan
        - location cannot be changed after the organisation is created
    * **Blueprint**
        - automation template with configurations and functions
        - allow to share scenarios with others outside of the organisation
    * **Variables**
        - allow organisations to store data and reuse
        - System and Custom variables
