Project
-------

Team Management
===============

* `Team Performance Plan`_

Team Performance Plan

    * team leaders require planning, organising, training, communication, consultation, and
    conflict resolution skills
    * a team needs to have appropriate skills, defined purpose, common approach, and joint
    accountability
    * Functional Team: report to a single point, and may or may not have to work together to
    meet group goals
    * Cross-functional Team: members from different functions working for the team and other
    functional duties
    * can conduct meetings, interviews, brainstorming sessions, and email communication methods
    for feedback and consultation
    * **Team Charter**
        - document of purpose and structure of group or organisation, made in negotiation with
        a team sponsor, leader and relevant members
        - establish when a team is formed, or is in trouble to see the big picture
        - a general format includes context, mission and objectives, composition and roles,
        support framework

    methods to monitor, evaluate and reward performance
    * define expectations, determine milestones to assist in monitoring progress, and agree on
    a set of terms
    * **KPIs**
        - collaborate with stakeholders when developing KPIs, concise KPIs are less likely to
        be misunderstood

    * provide encouragement when poor performance, and praise for exemplary behaviour
    * **Performance Deficiency**

        and monitor the performance
        - Performance Improvement Plan contains area to improve, actions to be taken,
        necessary support, follow-up by team leader, deadline for improvement, and assessment
